# The Teaching Wizard

A Database of Pedagogical Strategies and Search Interface.

**Project:** https://onlinelearning.aalto.fi/aol/pilot/the-teaching-wizard

**Demo:** https://luis.leiva.name/atm/

## Installation

The following sections don't assume a Dockerized system, though it is highly encouraged.
Below you can find instructions for a Docker installation.

### Configuration

Create a copy of the `sample.env` as `.env`:
```
~$ cp sample.env .env
```

You can adjust the configuration in this file.

Edit the authentication options `AUTH_USER` and `AUTH_HASH`
that must be changed before the admin interface can be accessed.

To do so, run the following command with a new password:
```
~$ php -r 'echo password_hash("<NEW_PASS>", PASSWORD_DEFAULT) . "\n";'
```
Copy the result into `AUTH_HASH` (make sure not to copy any unrelated characters).

### Database

Currently both SQLite and MySQL engines are supported.

#### SQLite installation

Ensure you have SQLite installed:
```
~$ sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3
~$ php -r 'var_dump(class_exists("SQLite3"));'
```

Export the DB definition:
```
~$ php -f data/tsv2sqlite.php > data/sqlite.sql
```

Initialize DB via:
```
~$ sqlite3 data/methods.db < data/sqlite.sql
```

And set `PDO_URI=sqlite:<ABSPATH>/data/methods.db` in your `.env` file,
where `<ABSPATH>` is the absolute path of this repository in your hard drive.


##### Docker

If running on Docker, set `PDO_URI=sqlite:/usr/data/methods.db` in your `.env` file,
since the absolute path of the Dockerized system is `/usr`.

Be sure to uncomment the volume includes for the `api` and `admin` services.
The lines are marked before with 

`# If using SQLite, include volume to database file`.

You can comment out the `db` service (MySQL) in that case.

#### MySQL installation

Ensure you have a MySQL server installed:
```
~$ sudo apt install mysql-server
```

Export the DB definition:
```
~$ php -f data/tsv2mysql.php > data/mysql.sql
```

Set the auth credentials (`PDO_USER` and `PDO_PASS`) in your `.env` file.

Initialize DB via:
```
~$ mysql -u PDO_USER -p'PDO_PASS' < data/mysql.sql
```
where `PDO_USER` and `PDO_PASS` are the values you set before in your `.env` file.

And set `PDO_URI="mysql:host=localhost;dbname=teaching_wizard"` in your `.env` file.

##### Docker

If running on Docker, use the database host name `db` in the connection URI in your `.env` file,
like so: `PDO_URI="mysql:host=db;dbname=teaching_wizard"`.

Also, you must set the variables `PDO_USER`, `PDO_PASS`, `MYSQL_ROOT_PASS`,
and `PDO_DATABASE` (make sure it matches the `dbname=` property of the `PDO_URI`).

You may want to customize the forwarded port of the Docker database to your host machine with the
`DB_PORT` setting (e.g., if you have a local MySQL database running as well).
This is just to enable the usage of other MySQL clients to connect to the database server.

These settings must be set before starting the MySQL container for the first time.

Initializing the database must be done after it has started for the first time, see below.

### HTTPS support

The following instructions apply to the Dockerized installation only.

You can enable HTTPS support by uncommenting in your `.env` file the line
```
#;NGINX_CONF=site-ssl.conf
```
By default, it uses a self-signed certificate for `localhost`.

You can replace the provided certificates in `./docker/nginx/ssl/server.{crt,key}`
either with your own self-generated one by running the `./docker/ssl-generate.sh` script,
or with a proper SSL certificate, such as those provided by https://letsencrypt.org

Adjust accordingly the settings `SERVER_NAME` to match the certificate domain
and `HTTPS_PORT` if needed, and rebuild the `nginx` container via `docker-compose build nginx`.

#### Using Let's Encrypt

If you go for the Dockerized installation,
there is a certbot image available but disabled in the current config.
Enable it by uncommenting the lines in `docker-compose.yml` and retrieve a certificate from Let's Encrypt
with the command `docker-compose run --rm certbot certonly`.
You should be able to select the second option as the default nginx config serves the certbot challenge.

The certificate will be saved in a location like `./docker/nginx/ssl/certbot/live/<domain>`,
so adjust your nginx config accordingly.

Also, don't forget to renew it regularly!
You can take a look at https://medium.com/@pentacent/b4b8a60d3a71
for an example on how to do automatic renewal in a docker-compose setup.

## Dockerized web services

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed.

Build the containers via:
```
~$ docker-compose build
```

Then you can run them in composition:
```
~$ docker-compose up
```

When using mysql, make sure it has successfully initialized the server,
and then run the script `import-db.sh` in your root directory to import the default data:

```
~$ bash docker/import-db.sh
```

The services are now available at:
* Main interface: http://localhost:8080/
* API: http://localhost:8080/api/
* Admin: http://localhost:8080/admin/
