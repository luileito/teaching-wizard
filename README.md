# The Teaching Wizard

A Database of Pedagogical Strategies and Search Interface.

**Project:** https://onlinelearning.aalto.fi/aol/pilot/the-teaching-wizard

**Demo:** https://luis.leiva.name/atm/

## Installation

The following sections don't assume a Dockerized system, though it is highly encouraged.
Below you can find instructions for a Docker installation.

### Configuration

Create a copy of the `sample.env` as `.env`:
```
~$ cp sample.env .env
```

You can adjust the configuration in this file.
As of now, you should only edit the authentication options `AUTH_USER` and `AUTH_HASH`
that must be changed before the admin interface can be accessed.

To do so, run the following command with a new password:
```
~$ php -r 'echo password_hash("<NEW_PASS>", PASSWORD_DEFAULT) . "\n";'
```
Copy the result into `AUTH_HASH` (make sure not to copy any unrelated characters).

### Database

Currently both SQLite and MySQL engines are supported.

#### SQLite installation

Ensure you have SQLite installed:
```
~$ sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3
~$ php -r 'var_dump(class_exists("SQLite3"));'
```

Export the DB definition:
```
~$ php -f data/tsv2sqlite.php > data/sqlite.sql
```

Initialize DB via:
```
~$ sqlite3 data/methods.db < data/sqlite.sql
```

And set `PDO_URI=sqlite:<ABSPATH>/data/methods.db` in your `.env` file,
where `<ABSPATH>` is the absolute path of this repository in your hard drive.

**Note:** If running on Docker, set `PDO_URI=sqlite:/usr/data/methods.db` in your `.env` file,
since the absolute path of the Dockerized system is `/usr`.

#### MySQL installation

Ensure you have a MySQL server installed:
```
~$ sudo apt install mysql-server
```

Export the DB definition:
```
~$ php -f data/tsv2mysql.php > data/mysql.sql
```

Set the auth credentials (`PDO_USER` and `PDO_PASS`) in your `.env` file.

Initialize DB via:
```
~$ mysql -u PDO_USER -p'PDO_PASS' < data/mysql.sql
```
where `PDO_USER` and `PDO_PASS` are the values you set before in your `.env` file.

And set `PDO_URI=mysql:host=localhost;dbname=teaching_wizard` in your `.env` file.

### HTTPS support

The following instructions apply to the Dockerized installation only.

You can enable HTTPS support by uncommenting in your `.env` file the line
```
#;NGINX_CONF=site-ssl.conf
```
By default, it uses a self-signed certificate for `localhost`.

You can replace the provided certificates in `./docker/nginx/ssl/server.{crt,key}`
either with your own self-generated one by running the `./docker/ssl-generate.sh` script,
or with a proper SSL certificate, such as those provided by https://letsencrypt.org

Adjust accordingly the settings `SERVER_NAME` to match the certificate domain
and `HTTPS_PORT` if needed, and rebuild the `nginx` container via `docker-compose build nginx`.

#### Using Let's Encrypt

If you go for the Dockerized installation,
there is a certbot image available but disabled in the current config.
Enable it by uncommenting the lines in `docker-compose.yml` and retrieve a certificate from Let's Encrypt
with the command `docker-compose run --rm certbot certonly`.
You should be able to select the second option as the default nginx config serves the certbot challenge.

The certificate will be saved in a location like `./docker/nginx/ssl/certbot/live/<domain>`,
so adjust your nginx config accordingly.

Also, don't forget to renew it regularly!
You can take a look at https://medium.com/@pentacent/b4b8a60d3a71
for an example on how to do automatic renewal in a docker-compose setup.

## Dockerized web services

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed.

Build the containers via:
```
~$ docker-compose build
```

Then you can run them in composition:
```
~$ docker-compose up
```

The services are now available at:
* Main interface: http://localhost:8080/
* API: http://localhost:8080/api/
* Admin: http://localhost:8080/admin/
