# The Teaching Wizard

A Database of Pedagogical Strategies and Search Interface.

**Project:** https://onlinelearning.aalto.fi/aol/pilot/the-teaching-wizard

**Demo:** https://luis.leiva.name/atm/

## Installation

### Database

Ensure you have SQLite installed:
```
~$ php -r 'var_dump(class_exists("SQLite3"));'
```

And initialize DB via:
```
~$ sqlite3 data/methods.db < data/create.sql
```

### Configuration

Create a copy of the `sample.env` as `.env`:
```
~$ cp sample.env .env
```

You can adjust the configuration in this file.
As of now, you should only edit the authentication options `AUTH_USER` and `AUTH_HASH`
that must be changed before the admin interface can be accessed.

To do so, run the following command with a new password:
```
~$ php -r 'echo password_hash("<NEW_PASS>", PASSWORD_DEFAULT) . "\n";'
```
Copy the result into `AUTH_HASH` (make sure not to copy any unrelated characters).

### HTTPS support

You can enable HTTPS support by uncommenting the line
```
#;NGINX_CONF=site-ssl.conf
```
in the `.env` file.
By default, it uses a self-signed certificate for `localhost`.

You can replace the provided certificates in `./docker/nginx/ssl/server.{crt,key}`
either with your own self-generated one
by running the `./docker/ssl-generate.sh` script, 
or with a proper SSL certificate.

Adjust accordingly the settings `SERVER_NAME` to match the certificate domain
 and `HTTPS_PORT` if desired. 
 
Rebuild the `nginx` container after changing these settings via `docker-compose build nginx`.

#### Using Let's Encrypt

The certbot docker image is available but disabled in the current config.
Enable it by uncommenting the lines in `docker-compose.yml` to be able to use it.

If you are running on a proper server, at this point the SSL option from above should not be enabled yet.

To retrieve a certificate from Let's Encrypt, 
run the command `docker-compose run --rm certbot certonly`.
You should be able to select the second option as the default nginx config serves the certbot challenge.

You will need to do additional changes, to integrate the certificate after retrieving it.
The certificate will be saved in a different file (most likely in `./docker/nginx/ssl/certbot/live/<domain>`),
so adjust the nginx config accordingly.

Also, don't forget to renew it regularly.
You can take a look at https://medium.com/@pentacent/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71
for an example on how to integrate the automatic renewal properly into a docker-compose setup.

### Web services

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed.

Build the containers via:
```
~$ docker-compose build
```

Then you can run them in composition:
```
~$ docker-compose up
```

The service is now available at:
* Main interface: http://localhost:8080/
* API: http://localhost:8080/api/
* Admin: http://localhost:8080/admin/
